# automl-chatbot
An end to end machine learning chatbot interface for automating the process of scalable machine learning pipeline generation. Aimed at helping Data scientist and Machine Learning Engineers in the decision-making process, by saving their time, effort and effectively generating solutions.

• Integrated Azure AutoML with Rasa natural language understanding bot framework, for generating machine learning pipelines for different machine learning tasks such as classification, and regression.
• The bot applies a set of machine learning algorithms, and different versions of their ensemble on the dataset provided to choose the most efficient algorithm based on a user-defined metric.
